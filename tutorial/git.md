# Git Basics: A Simple Manual

## Introduction

Git is a version control system that helps you manage your code and collaborate with others. This manual will cover some basic Git commands to get you started.

## Table of Contents

1. **Setting Up Git**
   - Install Git on your computer. You can download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and follow the installation instructions.

2. **Configuring Git**
   - After installation, set your name and email using the following commands:
     ```
     git config --global user.name "Your Name"
     git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
     ```

3. **Creating a New Repository**

   - **Local Repository**: To start a new project with Git, create a new directory and navigate into it. Then run:
     ```
     git init
     ```
    > This step is better to be done on GitHub.
   
   - **Clone Repository**: To work on an existing project, clone it from a remote repository using:
     ```
     git clone <remote_url>
     ```
     
   - **Switching Branches**: Create and switch to a new branch with:
     ```
     git checkout -b <branch_name>
     ```

4. **Basic Commands**


   - **Adding Files**: Stage changes for commit using:
     ```
     git add <filename>
     ```

   - **Committing Changes**: Save staged changes to your local repository with:
     ```
     git commit -m "Your commit message"
     ```
    Use `-a` to tell the command to automatically stage files that have been modified and deleted. So, you don't need to use `git add` anymore. For new files, `git add` should be used.
     ```
     git commit -am "Your commit message"
     ```

5. **Collaboration**

   - **Pushing Changes**: Upload your local commits to a remote repository using:
     ```
     git push origin <branch_name>
     ```

   - **Pulling Changes**: Retrieve and merge changes from the remote repository with:
     ```
     git pull origin <branch_name>
     ```
    
6. **View Commands**

   - **Checking Status**: To see which files are staged or modified, use:
     ```
     git status
     ```

   - **Viewing Commit History**: See a list of past commits using:
     ```
     git log
     ```
